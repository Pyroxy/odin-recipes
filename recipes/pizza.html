        With a good whole grain crust and lots of veggie toppings, homemade pizza is a filling meal on its own. If we want something on the side, though, my first choice is always a seasonal salad. 
    A simple green salad or arugula salad is an easy, fresh option, but if I’m not tossing greens together, 
    I’ll often use leftover pizza toppings to make a fun, flavorful side salad.
